    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My professional journey began with a fascination for Operations Research as a specialty. I was captivated by how its techniques could be applied to solve complex problems in the most optimal way. This sparked my passion for analysis and problem-solving, and I quickly realized that I have a strong knack for finding innovative solutions. My analytical mindset is complemented by a creative approach, allowing me to develop unique solutions across various domains.</p>
    <p>As I delved deeper into problem-solving, I found myself drawn to the power of technology in presenting these solutions. This led me to pursue web development, where I could bring my ideas to life through powerful digital tools. Today, I’m a web developer with a focus on creating effective, user-friendly solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
